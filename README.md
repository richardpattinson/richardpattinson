</div>

Aspiring developer and university of Bath Alumni. After graduating I worked for Hampshire Trust Bank setting up Experian API calls using Snaplogic and developing front end internal applications using Matssoft. In order to build on the development skills and agile practices used at the bank, I enrolled at makers academy, a software development bootcamp with a great track record of aiding new developers to acquire hands on experience working in teams, designing, implementing and testing their own applications. These hard skills in the ruby, python and javascript languages along with the ancillary skills of good git collaboration practices and mastery of workï¬‚ow tools (such as jira and trello) put me in a great position to be an asset to any development team.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Dec '19 - Apr '20)

After the end of my contract at Hampshire trust bank I embarked upon the next stage of my career training in software development. Primary languages studied were ruby, python and JavaScript. Please go to my GitHub linked in the header to see some examples of the projects I have worked on and the skills I have learned.

#### University of Bath (Sept '14 - Jun '17)

BSc Chemistry | Grade 2:2

As part of my chemistry degree I completed a dissertation on modeling the surfaces of solid oxide exchange fuel cells. This was done using  Metadise to determine the properties of the oxide exchange cathode and these properties were used to generate a 3D crystal structure. This project introduced me to the python programming language and prompted me to continue learn the language independently.
